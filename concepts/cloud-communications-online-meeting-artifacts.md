Online meeting artifacts are content produced for the duration of an online meeting or [Microsoft Teams live event](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events).

  - Available for meetings other than Teams live events
  - Only available when the meeting has concluded
  - Only the meeting organizer can access
- Recordings of a Teams live event, in the form of a download link that expires in 60 seconds. Recordings have the following characteristics:
  - Only available for Teams live events
  - Only available when the Teams live event has concluded
  - Only the Teams live event organizer can access
- Attendee report of a Teams live event, in the form of a download link that expires in 60 seconds. Attendee reports have the following characteristics:
